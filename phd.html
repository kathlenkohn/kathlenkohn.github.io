                  <h3>PhD position in Algebraic Geometry and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                  <p class="info">Application deadline <span>&bull;</span> <em class="date">TBA</em></p>
		  The successful candidate will pursue a PhD project centered around algebraic geometry and its interactions with artificial intelligence under the supervision of <a href="https://kathlenkohn.github.io/"Kathlén Kohn</a>.
		 The position is a time-limited, full-time, five year position starting August 2020 or at an agreed upon date.
The position is fully funded for four years and will be extended to five years by assigning teaching duties.
It also includes generous travel support.
The position is financed within the Wallenberg Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP), and the student will participate in the WASP graduate school.
Through this program the student will have a wide variety of opportunities to interact with other researchers and industry collaborators, including events such as conferences and PhD courses.
Moreover, the successful candidate will be part of a vibrant and diverse group in algebraic geometry as well as the newly established unit “Mathematics of Data and AI”.
There will also be a strong interactions with the “Brummer & Partners MathDataLab” which is a research lab in mathematics and applied mathematics, hosted at the Department of Mathematics,  that aims at creating a hub for mathematical research in the analysis of complex data.	       
		  Students interested in fields related to the following are encouraged to apply: algebraic / tropical / complex / differential / discrete geometry, artificial intelligence, invariant theory, statistics.
		       </br></br>		 
		    Possible research projects in the direction of <b>MACHINE LEARNING</b> are:
		    	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  				<li>Study the <b>neuromanifold</b> of a neural network, i.e., the functional space parametrized by the network. For instance, neuromanifolds of ReLU networks are <b>semi-algebraic sets</b> and it is an open problem to characterize them algebraically.</li>
  				<li>Study the <b>loss landscape</b> of a neural network with a loss function. Understanding the number and type of critical points of supervised learning is a major open problem. From the point of view of algebraic geometry the nature of critical points is governed by <b>ED degrees and ED discriminants</b> and thus connects to classical objects in intersection theory such as Chern classes.</li>
 				<li>Study the <b>dynamics</b> of optimization algorithms in supervised learning using <b>differential geometry</b>. In many practical situations gradient descent seems to converge to "nice" critical points. From the theoretical point of view, this phenomenon is not even fully understood for linear networks which are the simplest model of neural networks. </li>
				<li>Extend the dictionary between <b>tropical geometry</b> and ReLU networks. It was recently shown that <b>ReLU networks</b> parametrize exactly tropical rational functions. This correspondence should be further exploited to derive deeper relations between the properties of tropical functions and their associated networks. It is also important to explore the possibilities of parametrizing other families of neural networks with tropical or algebraic objects.</li>
				<li>Study <b>GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)</b> which are AI systems consisting of two (or more) neural networks. GANs perform incredibly well in practice but their behavior is poorly understood in theory. From the geometric point of view, GANs are <b>differentiable games</b> and the strategies of the involved players (neural networks) are vector fields.</li>
		    </ul>
		 </br>
	      Further research directions connecting algebraic geometry and <b>DATA SCIENCE</b> are:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li><b>Varieties of tensors</b> as tensors model <b>high-dimensional data</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Sampling</b> on algebraic varieties. This includes the study of probability distributions and random points on varieties as well as <b>variety learning</b> where (properties of) algebraic varieties are to be recovered from a given set of (possibly noisy) sample points.</li>
	<li><b>Algebraic statistics</b></li>
