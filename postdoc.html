			This multidisciplinary project is a <a class='link-in-text' href="https://wasp-sweden.org/nests-new-excellent-research-environments-in-wasp/">WASP NEST (Novelty, Excellence, Synergy, Teams)</a>
			with a total duration of 5 years, starting in April 2022.
			<br><br>
			  <b>The Team:</b> The project is led by the four principal investigators listed above.
			  In addition to the postdoc and researcher from this announcement, three PhD students will be hired for the project (one at each of the three involved universities).
			  To facilitate transfer of results and experience from the project for further exploitation in industry, the project will collaborate with a group of industrial partners: 
			  <a class='link-in-text' href="https://www.hm.com/">H&M</a>, 
			  <a class='link-in-text' href="https://www.volvocars.com/">Volvo Cars</a>,

			  <a class='link-in-text' href="https://www.embellencegroup.com/">Embellence Group</a>.
			  <br>
			  The NEST will organize regular joint seminars and workshops. Moreover, regular visits among the involved sites are possible and encouraged.

			 <b>The Goal:</b> 
			  In recent years, generative neural network models for creation of photo-realistic images have become increasingly popular.
			  Their training results in a low-dimensional latent space representation of a distribution from which new examples can be drawn and images be generated.
			  To be able to control and manipulate the images, one aims for a disentangled latent representation, so that different qualities of the resulting images are kept separate.
			  For example, the shape of an object can be separated from its material properties, the viewing direction and the overall illumination.
			  <br>
			  In this project, we will go one step further and develop disentangled latent representations, not just for individual objects, but for full three-dimensional scenes with multiple objects that might change over time.
			  The goal is to provide support for operations like adding, modifying and removing objects, changing scene conditions, modelling scene dynamics, as well as automatically complete missing parts of the 3D scene.
			<br><br>
			 <b>Possible Projects:</b>
			  To successfully complete the project, it is necessary to develop both new theory and algorithms.
			  On the theoretical side, algebra and geometry can be used to address the following problems:
			 <ol>
  <li><b>Disentanglement </b>  is a widely used concept and one of the most ambitious challenges in learning. Yet, it still lacks a widely accepted formal definition.
The challenge is to develop learning algorithms that disentangle the different factors of variation in the data, but what  exactly that means highly depends on the application at hand.
For instance, in order to be able to modify content of an indoor scene, we seek algorithms to learn situated and semantic encodings (e.g., positions and colors of objects or lighting).
Several mathematical ideas have been proposed to provide a formal definition of disentanglement (e.g., statistical independence,

	  but none of them applies to all practical settings where disentanglement is used.
We aim to develop a more generally applicable formal definition and to study theoretical guarantees of what can be achieved with disentanglement.</li>

                     An important aspect of autoencoders is their ability to memorize the training data, which has been
                     recently explored from a dynamical systems perspective.
                     Empirical results suggest that training examples form attractors of these autoencoders, but the
                     theoretical reasons behind that mechanism are still not clear.
                     Algebraic techniques can be applied in the setting of ReLU autoencoders with Euclidean loss, as the
                     underlying geometric problem is to find a closest point on a semi-algebraic set.
                     An open conjecture is that all training examples are attractors in a (global) minimum of the
                     Euclidean
                     loss of a sufficiently deep ReLU autoencoder.
                     This project would investigate that conjecture as well as further conditions under which attractors
                     are formed.

                  <img class='ellipse' src='images/ellipse_caustic.svg' alt='caustic of an ellipse'></img>
                  <p class='classic-paragraph'>
                     As linear networks are the easiest type of neural networks, many of their properties are well
                     understood, including the structure of their critical points when using the Euclidean loss
                     function.
                     However, it remains an open problem to show that generic initializations of the network converge
                     under
                     gradient flow to a global minimum.
                     Another project is therefore to investigate this conjecture and possibly expand it to other types
                     of
                     networks or loss functions.

                  <h3 class='h3-header'>Convergence in low-rank matrix factorization models </h3>

                     A similar behavior is observed in low-rank matrix models.
                     Recent work has shown that global convergence is possible under certain settings of linear matrix
                     measurement using Gaussian matrices.
                     However, this convergence behavior is observed for much wider classes of measurement operators.
                     In particular, replacing the Gaussian sensing matrices with certain integral operators representing
                     tomographic projection, global convergence is observed in a wide range of configurations.
                     This particular setup has applications to the heterogeneity problem in cryo-EM, where a low-rank
                     factorization model can be used to characterize the structural variability of three-dimensional
                     density maps representing the imaged molecule.
                     This project would investigate this behavior and extend previous convergence results to wider
                     settings
                     of measurement operators.
